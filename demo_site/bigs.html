      <p>All <q>Big</q> problem sets will be posted here as they are released (no later than 5pm on the Thursday before the deadline).</p>
      <h1 data-number="1" id="instructions"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Instructions</h1>
      <p>Big problem sets (except for big 4) are due every Monday. These problems are typically more challenging, so I recommend you start them early. In my experience with solving tricky problems, it is more productive to work on them in short bursts, with breaks in between. To solve a hard problem, it’s less about the number of hours you spend working on it than it is about the number of showers.</p>
      <h1 data-number="2" id="policies"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Policies</h1>
      <p>If you opted into working with a cohort, your entire cohort may submit a single collaborative writeup. If you are not working in a cohort, you may collaborate with up to 5 other people (i.e. a group of up to 6 total) when completing exercises, but your collaboration must be <a href="syllabus.html">Whiteboard Only</a> You may additionally use external materials with following restrictions:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Your write-ups must be done entirely independently. You may take notes while meeting with your collaborators, but we expect that the answers you submit be expressed in your own words.</li>
      <li>You must understand everything you submit. Do not submit anything you could not explain to a member of the course staff.</li>
      <li>You <strong>must</strong> cite any and every source you consult beyond officially-provided materials (see list above). Included in your citation, you must identify which components of your submission came from each source (it will be understood that content with no citation is your own exclusive work). Your collaborators are considered to be sources, and so should be cited. An example citation might look like: <q>I collaborated with David Evans on the pdf style, I consulted  for help with the align environment, Robbie Hott helped me to debug the for loop on line 107 of my code.</q></li>
      <li>Do not seek <q>hints</q> or entire solutions to the problems. Limit your searching to background information only.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1 data-number="3" id="deliverables"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Deliverables</h1>
      <p>Unless otherwise indicated, each problem set will be submitted as a pdf on the <a href="https://www.kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cs4102">Assignments page</a>. We do not have a preference for how the pdfs are generated (LaTeX, Microsoft Word, pictures of handwriting are all acceptable) so long as what is submitted is legible, and you use the appropriate mathematical symbols when necessary (please use the equation editor if you’re using Word).</p>
      <h1 data-number="4" id="problem-sets"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Problem Sets</h1>
      <h2 data-number="4.1" id="big-1"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Big 1</h2>
      <p>Due 11:59pm Monday June 27.</p>
      <p>This assignment is intended to give you experience with the design and analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms. The problems will derive from content learned during the first week of lecture (June 21, June 22, June 23, June 24, and June 25).</p>
      <p>Please answer the questions on <a href="files/bigs/big1_blank.pdf">this worksheet</a> (<a href="files/bigs/big1.zip">tex source</a>). Submit your answers as a pdf.</p>
      <h2 data-number="4.2" id="big-2"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Big 2</h2>
      <p>Due 11:59pm Tuesday July 5.</p>
      <p>This assignment is intended to give you experience with the design and analysis of dynamic programming algorithms. The problems will derive from content learned during the lectures given on June 29, June 30, and July 1.</p>
      <p>Please answer the questions on <a href="files/bigs/big2_blank.pdf">this worksheet</a> (<a href="files/bigs/big2.zip">tex source</a>). Submit your answers as a pdf.</p>
      <h2 data-number="4.3" id="big-3"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Big 3</h2>
      <p>Due 11:59pm Tuesday July 12.</p>
      <p>This assignment is intended to give you experience with the design and analysis of greedy algorithms. The problems will derive from content learned during the lectures given on July 5, July 6, July 7, and July 8.</p>
      <p>Please answer the questions on <a href="files/bigs/big3_blank.pdf">this worksheet</a> (<a href="files/bigs/big3.zip">tex source</a>). Submit your answers as a pdf.</p>
      <h2 data-number="4.4" id="big-4"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Big 4</h2>
      <p>Due 11:59pm Saturday July 16 (in lieue of a final exam).</p>
      <p>This assignment is intended to give you experience with the design and analysis of algorithms using reductions, the use of reductions for giving worst-case lower bounds, and NP-Completeness. The problems will primarily derive from content learned during the lectures given on July 11, July 12, July 13, and July 14, however due to the fact that reductions leverage algorithms that you already know, this problem set is best considered to be cumulative over the entire semester.</p>
      <p>Please answer the questions on <a href="files/bigs/big4_blank.pdf">this worksheet</a> (<a href="files/bigs/big4.zip">tex source</a>). Submit your answers as a pdf.</p>
